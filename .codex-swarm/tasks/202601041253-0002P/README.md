description: "Add a clear, unambiguous definition of workflow_mode values \\\"direct\\\" and \\\"branch_pr\\\" across agent instructions and documentation. Document the operational differences (where work happens, whether task branches/worktrees are required, who can write tasks.json, required PR artifacts under docs/workflow/T-###/pr, and which agent is allowed to integrate/finish). Update AGENTS.md and .codex-swarm/agentctl.md accordingly."
