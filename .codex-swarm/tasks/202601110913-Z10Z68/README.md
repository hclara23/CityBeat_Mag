description: "Change owner=AUTOMATION tasks to a real agent (CODER) and adjust README/docs to guide first-time users vs full docs."
---
## Summary

Swap legacy owner=AUTOMATION to CODER across tasks and adjust README/docs to separate newcomer quickstart from full reference.

## Context

Lint warnings came from owner=AUTOMATION; docs needed clearer split between newcomer quickstart (root README) and full docs (docs/README).

## Scope

- Replace owner=AUTOMATION with CODER in all tasks.
- Regenerate tasks.json export.
- Refresh root README for first-time quickstart emphasis and point to docs/README.md for the full guide.
- Update docs/README.md to clarify it is the full reference.

## Risks

- Bulk owner changes touch many files; must avoid altering other metadata.
- README simplification should not hide links to full docs.

## Verify Steps

- python -m py_compile .codex-swarm/backends/redmine/backend.py
- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task lint

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the owner changes and README/docs edits.
