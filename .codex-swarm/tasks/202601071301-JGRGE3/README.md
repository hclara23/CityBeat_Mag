description: "Reduce duplicated workflow_mode and handoff guidance across agent JSONs/AGENTS.md by pointing to agentctl.md. Unify task-id/suffix terminology in agent instructions and docs."
---
## Summary

- Consolidated workflow_mode guidance to reference @.codex-swarm/agentctl.md.
- Standardized task-id placeholders to `<task-id>` across agents and docs.
- Switched handoff instructions to `agentctl pr note` and removed repeated snapshot filename mentions.

## Goal

- Reduce duplicated workflow rules and normalize terminology across agent instructions.

## Scope

- @AGENTS.md
- @.codex-swarm/agentctl.md
- @.codex-swarm/agents/*.json

## Risks

- Low: terminology updates could require follow-up if other docs expect old placeholders.

## Verify Steps

- None (doc/instruction changes only).

## Rollback Plan

- Revert commit `1b7c1e375690`.
