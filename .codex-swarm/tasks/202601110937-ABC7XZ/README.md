## Summary

Emit a consistent status line for successful agentctl commands so automation can read results directly.

## Context

- Agents need an explicit success signal after each agentctl invocation to sync context without probing logs.
- Commands can exit via SystemExit(0), so the footer must still appear when output isn't suppressed.

## Scope

- Compute the executed subcommand path (including nested parsers) via command_path.
- Print a final success footer (`✅ <path> OK`) for non-quiet/non-json runs, even when commands exit with SystemExit(0).
- Keep quiet/json modes untouched to avoid polluting structured outputs.

## Risks

- Extra stdout footer could surprise tooling that expected previous formatting.
- Some commands already emit a success marker, so consumers may see duplicate ✅ lines.

## Verify Steps

- python -m compileall .codex-swarm/agentctl.py
- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task lint

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the status-footer commit and restore agentctl.py.
- Rerun python -m compileall .codex-swarm/agentctl.py and python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task lint to confirm a clean state.
