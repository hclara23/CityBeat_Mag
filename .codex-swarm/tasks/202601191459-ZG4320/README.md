description: "Replace textual low/normal/high priority labels in the task viewer with icon-based indicators for cards, tables, tooltips, and drawer."
---
## Summary

Replace priority text labels in the task viewer with icon indicators for low/normal/high.

## Context

The viewer currently renders priority as plain text across cards, table rows, tooltips, and the drawer.

## Scope

Introduce priority icon styles and SVGs, then swap priority renderers to show icons in the viewer UI.

## Risks

Icons could be unclear without hover context; include title/aria labels to preserve meaning.

## Verify Steps

Run ./viewer.sh, open the viewer, and confirm priority renders as icons in kanban cards, table rows, tooltips, and the drawer.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the changes in .codex-swarm/viewer/tasks.html and reload the viewer.
