## Summary

Validate that Redmine backend supports create/update/comment flows via agentctl in sandbox.

## Context

- Need assurance that Redmine backend works end-to-end with the current CLI without backend-specific hacks.
- Sandbox project is cleared; repo state is canonical so new tasks should appear and round-trip cleanly.

## Scope

- Create the task via Redmine backend and confirm it appears in task list.
- Update doc sections and add a comment to verify custom fields and journals.
- Pull the task again to confirm fields persist.

## Risks

- API latency could cause commands to time out; retries may be needed.
- If sandbox contains old data, lists may mix test and legacy issues.

## Verify Steps

- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task show 202601111002-FZ099X --quiet
- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task comment 202601111002-FZ099X --author CODER --body "Test comment via Redmine backend"
- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task doc show 202601111002-FZ099X --quiet

## Rollback Plan

- Delete the test issue from Redmine if it pollutes the sandbox.
- Re-run task list to confirm it is gone.
