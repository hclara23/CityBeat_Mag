## Summary

Remove docs/ROADMAP.md and confirm no references remain.

## Context

User requested removing the ROADMAP document from the repo.

## Scope

Delete docs/ROADMAP.md and scan the repo for lingering references.

## Risks

Low risk; only documentation removal. Residual risk is an unseen reference outside the repo search.

## Verify Steps

rg -n "ROADMAP" .

## Rollback Plan

Restore docs/ROADMAP.md from git history if needed.

## Notes

ROADMAP.md was already deleted in the working tree; kept deletion and validated no references.
