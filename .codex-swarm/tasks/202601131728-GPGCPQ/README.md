## Summary

Normalize comment bodies used for comment-driven commits and store the normalized text in task comments to keep lengths aligned with commit subjects.

## Context

Comment-driven commit subjects are formatted from the raw comment body, which can diverge in length/content from the stored task comment; align them to avoid truncation or mismatch.

## Scope

Update agentctl comment/commit handling so formatted comment text is reused for both storage and commit subjects; document the behavior in agentctl.md.

## Risks

Normalizing comments may alter formatting for multi-line notes; keep the normalization consistent with commit subject formatting and document the change.

## Verify Steps

Manual: run a comment-driven start/block/finish and confirm the stored task comment matches the commit subject body.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the agentctl commit that normalizes stored comments to restore previous comment storage behavior.

## Notes

The normalized comment text should be identical to the commit subject body fragment produced by comment-driven commits.
