## Summary

Normalized priority values across tasks to the standard low/normal/high scheme.

## Context

Priorities were mixed between med/Нормальный and needed a single scheme.

## Scope

- Update all task frontmatter priority values to normal where med/Нормальный appeared.
- Fix any priority mentions in task notes to match the standard labels.

## Risks

- External systems expecting legacy labels may need a refresh.

## Verify Steps

- N/A (data normalization).

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the linked commits to restore legacy priority labels.

## Notes

- Priorities now appear only as low/normal/high in task metadata.
