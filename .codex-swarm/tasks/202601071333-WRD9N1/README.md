## Summary

- Reduced snapshot wording in README, docs, CONTRIBUTING, and cleanup notes.
- Kept tasks.json references only where needed for export/viewer guidance.

## Goal

- Minimize repeated snapshot phrasing while preserving export rules and commands.

## Scope

- @README.md
- @CONTRIBUTING.md
- @clean.sh
- @docs/01-overview.md
- @docs/03-setup.md
- @docs/04-architecture.md
- @docs/07-tasks-and-backends.md
- @docs/09-commands.md
- @docs/10-troubleshooting.md

## Risks

- Low: wording changes could hide explicit snapshot terminology some users expect.

## Verify Steps

- None (doc/instruction changes only).

## Rollback Plan

- Revert commit `c8cc07f9a242`.
