description: "Add a CLI command (agentctl role <ROLE>) that prints the role-specific command block from .codex-swarm/agentctl.md so agents can see only their guidance."
---
## Summary

Implemented agentctl role <ROLE> to print a single role block from agentctl.md and updated headings for parsing.

## Context

Agents need a quick way to see only their command guidance without scanning the full agentctl.md.

## Scope

Update agentctl.py to add the role command and update agentctl.md headings/usage.

## Risks

Low; parsing errors could hide guidance or print the wrong section.

## Verify Steps

Run: python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py role CODER

## Rollback Plan

Revert the command and doc heading changes.

## Notes

Verified locally with: python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py role CODER
