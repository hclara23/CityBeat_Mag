## Summary

Build the dashboard UI and preset controls in the cyberpunk viewer.

## Context

Dashboards should surface KPIs and breakdowns using fields already present in tasks.json, while keeping the existing neon/CRT aesthetic.

## Scope

- Add dashboard tab layout and styling.
- Render KPI cards, breakdown bars, and health lists.
- Add preset buttons and drill-down interactions.

## Risks

Risk: the UI may become dense on small screens; ensure responsive layout scales for mobile widths.

## Verify Steps

- Open the viewer and confirm dashboard cards render and respond to clicks.
- Check presets update task filters.

## Rollback Plan

Revert dashboard UI changes in `.codex-swarm/viewer/tasks.html`.

## Notes

Keep CSS aligned with existing cyberpunk palette and typography.
