description: "Capture the recent viewer redesign as a tracked task so the changes are documented and committed cleanly."
---
## Summary

Document the viewer redesign so it is tracked and committed as a standalone task.

## Scope

- Package the existing changes in the tasks viewer UI and server endpoint into this task.
- Keep the scope limited to the viewer refresh already implemented in `.codex-swarm/viewer/`.

## Risks

Risk: the refreshed UI could introduce regressions in filtering or status updates, so we should spot-check the main flows.

## Verify Steps

- Run the viewer locally and ensure the tabs, task list, and status updates render.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the viewer changes in `.codex-swarm/viewer/tasks.html` and `.codex-swarm/viewer/tasks_server.py` if issues arise.

## Notes

No additional dependencies or migrations.
