## Summary

Add a reverse-sort toggle to the task list UI so users can flip ordering without reloading.

## Context

Sorting currently supports asc/desc internally but lacks a control in the cyberpunk UI.

## Scope

- Add a reverse-sort toggle near the sort dropdown.
- Wire the toggle to ORDER_MODE and refresh rendering.

## Risks

Risk: UI clutter; keep the control compact.

## Verify Steps

- Click the reverse-sort toggle and ensure tasks reorder immediately.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the toggle control and handler changes in `.codex-swarm/viewer/tasks.html`.

## Notes

Reuse existing ORDER_MODE state and updateOrderToggle behavior.
