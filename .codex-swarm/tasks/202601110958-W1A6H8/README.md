## Summary

Switch backend to Redmine using env config and prove end-to-end sync from local source-of-truth tasks.

## Context

- Local repo tasks are the source of truth; Redmine can be used as a sandbox and cleared if needed.
- Need to verify agents can operate via the backend abstraction (list/new/update/doc/comments) without backend-specific assumptions.
- Sync must store intermediate context (docs/comments) cleanly in Redmine custom fields and journals.

## Scope

- Switch .codex-swarm/config.json to the Redmine backend (using existing env settings).
- Perform an initial sync/migration so Redmine mirrors the local task state (or starts clean).
- Exercise CRUD: list tasks, create a new task, update doc sections, append comments, and confirm they persist via pull.
- Validate sync push/pull behavior with the cache and ensure CLI outputs remain usable for agents.

## Risks

- Redmine project may contain legacy issues; mass migration could create clutter or conflicts.
- Network/API failures could leave cache and remote out of sync.
- Credentials are stored in .env; accidental logging of secrets must be avoided.

## Verify Steps

- python -m py_compile .codex-swarm/agentctl.py .codex-swarm/backends/redmine/backend.py
- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task migrate --source .codex-swarm/tasks.json --quiet
- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task list --quiet

## Rollback Plan

- Revert .codex-swarm/config.json to the local backend config.
- Clear any test issues in Redmine (or reset the project) if the migration polluted the sandbox.
- Re-run python -m py_compile .codex-swarm/agentctl.py .codex-swarm/backends/redmine/backend.py to ensure clean state.

## Notes

- Full migration of 150 tasks to Redmine hit HTTP timeouts; migrated a 3-task subset for smoke testing instead.\n- Created test task 202601111002-FZ099X via Redmine backend, updated docs, and added a comment to verify custom fields/journals.\n-  succeeds; owners/priorities reflect Redmine assignee/priority names (e.g., Via Mentis Assistant / "normal").
