## Summary

Route git staging/commits through agentctl so agents only change task status and agentctl builds <emoji> <task-suffix> <comment> subjects from their comments.

## Context

User requested removing direct git usage by agents; commits must be issued by agentctl using agent comments while keeping the <emoji> <suffix> extended comment format.

## Scope

Add comment-derived staging/commit helpers in agentctl for start/block/set-status/finish, document the flow in AGENTS.md + agentctl.md, and update CODER/TESTER/CREATOR agent specs to ban direct git usage.

## Risks

Auto-allow staging can capture unintended files if the working tree is dirty; finish comment commits are restricted to one task; start/block now export tasks snapshots before committing (extra output).

## Verify Steps

python -m py_compile .codex-swarm/agentctl.py\npython .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task lint

## Rollback Plan

Restore .codex-swarm/agentctl.py, AGENTS.md, and the updated agent JSON files to the previous revision, re-export tasks via agentctl, and rerun task lint.

## Notes

Comment-driven commit flags auto-derive allowlists when none are provided; start/block/set-status default to staging tasks changes, and finish enables the status commit automatically when --commit-from-comment is used.
