description: "Extend agentctl to track last framework update date in config, compare against today, refresh from https://github.com/basilisk-labs/codex-swarm when stale or forced, and add CLI flags that trigger UPGRADER logic."
---
## Summary
- Implement agentctl support for tracking when the framework was last refreshed and automatically pulling upstream when the data is stale (older than 10 days) or a user forces the upgrade.
- Expose `python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py upgrade` and keep `.codex-swarm/config.json` aligned with the new metadata fields.

## Context
- The UPGRADER spec drives what data needs to be present in the config, so this task wires those pieces into agentctl and ensures the framework source is used consistently.
- The automation must protect itself with branch/worktree guards and only run from the pinned base branch.

## Scope
- Add helpers for `framework.last_update`, staleness detection, and persisting ISO timestamps.
- Introduce the `upgrade` command that enforces clean trees, branch checks, and `git pull --ff-only` from the configured source.
- Document the command in `.codex-swarm/agentctl.md` so agents know how to invoke it.

## Risks
- Pulling via `git pull --ff-only` will fail if the repo has diverged or the remote is unreachable; the command must surface errors cleanly so a human can fix the divergence.
- Running the upgrade on a dirty tree could accidentally stage unrelated changes; branch checks and `ensure_git_clean` protect us, but operators must heed those warnings.

## Verify Steps
- `python3 -m unittest tests.test_framework_upgrade` (covers the helper math that drives the decision to upgrade).
- `python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py upgrade --force` from a clean base branch to validate the end-to-end git pull plus timestamp update.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert the helper additions and the CLI definition in `.codex-swarm/agentctl.py` plus the `.codex-swarm/agentctl.md` reference if we detect unexpected behavior.
- Restore `.codex-swarm/config.json` to drop the `framework` section if persistence proves problematic.

## Notes
- This task feeds directly into the regression tests covered by `202601160958-AM3G42` so keep any future changes synchronized with that suite.
