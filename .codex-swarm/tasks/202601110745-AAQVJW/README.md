## Summary

Accept timestamp task IDs in branch parsing/PR flows and keep clean.sh/docs hints off the legacy T-### format.

## Context

Branch/PR helpers still parse only legacy task branches (`task/T-###/<slug>`), and clean.sh rewrites examples to T-123 even though the framework now uses timestamp-based task IDs. This blocks branch_pr mode and produces stale docs after cleanup.

## Scope

- Update task-branch parsing to accept timestamp IDs while preserving legacy T-### support.
- Refresh CLI hints to reference `<task-id>` instead of `<T-###>`.
- Modernize clean.sh scrub replacements so examples stay on timestamp IDs.

## Risks

- Broader regex may allow unexpected branch names if patterns are too loose.
- clean.sh scrub logic could still drop needed instructions if replacements are incorrect.

## Verify Steps

- python -m py_compile .codex-swarm/agentctl.py .codex-swarm/backends/local/backend.py .codex-swarm/backends/redmine/backend.py

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the branch parsing and clean.sh changes.

## Notes

- Keep legacy T-### task branches working for old repositories; timestamp IDs are the primary path.
