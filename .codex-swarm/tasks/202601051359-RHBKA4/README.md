---
## Summary

- Make GitHub sync handle commit hashes stored as strings.
- Fix the Mermaid sequence diagram so it renders correctly.

## Scope

- `.github/scripts/sync_tasks.py`: accept string commit values in task payloads.
- `README.md`: add missing participant in Mermaid sequence.

## Risks

- Minimal; logic change is localized to formatting.

## Verify Steps

- `python3 .github/scripts/sync_tasks.py`

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the commit and re-run sync if needed.
