## Summary

Improve the Redmine backend (safer lookups, retries, no silent mutations, avoid reassignment) and add a REDMINE agent with backend-aware policies using only agentctl.

## Context

Redmine connector still does full scans per lookup, mutates missing task_id fields remotely, lacks retry/backoff, and forces an assignee even when one exists. We also lack an agent role to enforce Redmine-specific safety while using agentctl.

## Scope

- Add targeted task lookup in Redmine backend with cache and retry/backoff; avoid full rescan when possible.
- Remove auto-mutation of task_id for remote issues; skip invalid IDs instead.
- Respect existing assignees when writing; only set configured assignee when unassigned.
- Add simple retry/backoff for API calls with 429/5xx handling.
- Introduce REDMINE agent JSON with policies (no reassignment if assigned, use agentctl/sync, respect config fields).

## Risks

- API search by custom field may behave differently across Redmine deployments; fallback must still succeed.
- Retry/backoff could mask persistent failures if not surfaced.
- Skipping invalid task IDs may hide data inconsistencies.

## Verify Steps

- python -m py_compile .codex-swarm/backends/redmine/backend.py .codex-swarm/agentctl.py

## Rollback Plan

- Revert Redmine backend and REDMINE agent changes.

## Notes

- Keep behavior backend-agnostic for other agents; REDMINE agent documents backend expectations.
