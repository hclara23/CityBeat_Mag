## Summary

Added concise inline comments in agentctl.py to clarify backend capability checks, hook guardrails, config loading, and commit allowlist flow.

## Context

Requested to add human-readable comments in agentctl.py to make non-obvious logic easier to follow.

## Scope

Comment-only updates in .codex-swarm/agentctl.py; no behavior changes.

## Risks

Low risk: comments only. Potential risk is comments drifting if logic changes later.

## Verify Steps

Not run (comment-only change).

## Rollback Plan

Revert commit 8058e33 to remove the comment additions.

## Notes

No tests run.
