## Summary

Improve agentctl CLI outputs to include richer task context (deps, readiness, metadata) so agents need fewer follow-up commands.

## Context

User asked to make agentctl CLI outputs more informative so agents avoid extra status checks.

## Scope

- Enrich task list/show/ready outputs with dependency readiness and metadata.\n- Keep outputs compact and stable for CLI use.

## Risks

- More verbose output may affect scripts that parse human-readable CLI output.

## Verify Steps

- Run 'python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task show <task-id>' and 'python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task list' to confirm richer context.

## Rollback Plan

Revert agentctl output changes if verbosity breaks downstream scripting.

## Notes

Updated task list/show/ready/start/block/finish outputs to include deps/readiness/metadata summaries.

## Changes Summary

- Added dependency/owner/priority/tag/verify info to task list/search/next output lines.\n- Expanded task show output with readiness, doc metadata, verify commands, and comment counts.\n- Added richer summaries for ready/start/block/finish commands.
