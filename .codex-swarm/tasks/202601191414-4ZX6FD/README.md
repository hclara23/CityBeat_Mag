## Summary

Plan and track the viewer dashboard expansion, covering UI, data aggregation, and verification.

## Context

The current viewer already provides task lists, agents, and system tabs using tasks.json and agents.json. We want a dashboard layer using only available repo data and keep the cyberpunk visual language.

## Scope

- Add a dashboard tab with KPI cards and breakdowns derived from tasks.json.
- Add filter presets and drill-down interactions within the viewer.
- If needed, add API helpers in the viewer server to support dashboards.
- Run a smoke-check for the new dashboard UX and document verify steps.

## Risks

Risk: aggregations may be misleading if fields are missing or inconsistent, so the UI should handle empty/unknown values gracefully.

## Verify Steps

- Open the viewer and confirm dashboard KPIs render and presets filter tasks.
- Spot-check counts against visible task list for accuracy.

## Rollback Plan

Revert changes to `.codex-swarm/viewer/tasks.html` and `.codex-swarm/viewer/tasks_server.py`.

## Notes

Use only task fields present in `.codex-swarm/tasks.json` and agent definitions in `.codex-swarm/agents/*.json`.
