description: "Delete tests/test_framework_upgrade.py and update documentation now that the regression suite is gone."
---
## Summary
- Remove the regression suite that previously affirmed the framework upgrade helpers.

## Context
- The automated tests were added for the stale-detection math, but the user now requests deleting them.

## Scope
- Delete `tests/test_framework_upgrade.py` (along with the empty `tests/` directory).
- Update the related task doc to explain that verification now occurs manually.

## Risks
- Removing the only regression test leaves the helper logic unverified; future regression coverage should reintroduce a similar suite if needed.

## Verify Steps
- None (tests deleted by design).

## Rollback Plan
- Restore `tests/test_framework_upgrade.py` from Git history and revert this change if the regression coverage is required again.

## Notes
- There are no other references to `tests/test_framework_upgrade.py` once the file and doc updates are committed.
