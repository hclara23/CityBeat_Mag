## Summary

Propose config.json additions (verify requirements, task doc sections, comment requirements, branch/worktree paths, commit guard tuning, base_branch) plus agentctl toggles to switch them.

## Context

User asked to analyze the repo and suggest which settings should move into config.json so agents can honor them and switch them via agentctl.

## Scope

Reviewed config usage in .codex-swarm/config.json, .codex-swarm/agentctl.py, AGENTS.md, and key docs; produced a prioritized list of candidate config keys and example agentctl toggles. No code changes.

## Risks

Recommendations require agentctl changes; too many knobs may drift from AGENTS.md if not kept in sync.

## Verify Steps

rg -n "VERIFY_REQUIRED_TAGS|TASK_DOC_REQUIRED_SECTIONS|WORKTREES_DIRNAME|GENERIC_COMMIT_TOKENS" .codex-swarm/agentctl.py
rg -n "workflow_mode|config.json" AGENTS.md README.md docs/08-branching-and-pr-artifacts.md

## Rollback Plan

No code changes; revert this task README or delete the task if the analysis is no longer needed.

## Notes

Recommendations were implemented by later config/agentctl tasks (202601131304-D4ZA6S, 202601131304-7JXJF7, 202601131304-MV3TPX).
