## Summary

Add batch-friendly Redmine sync/migration with pauses to avoid API timeouts, then switch back to local backend.

## Context

- Full migration to Redmine timed out; need batching and pauses for write-heavy ops (migrate/sync push).
- Agents should keep using agentctl without backend-specific knowledge; rate limiting should be transparent.
- After testing, switch config back to the local backend.

## Scope

- Add batch size + pause settings to Redmine backend and apply them to write-heavy flows (write_tasks, sync push, migrate).
- Prefer backend write_tasks when migrating; fall back to single writes otherwise.
- Keep defaults conservative so existing users aren’t surprised.
- Restore .codex-swarm/config.json to the local backend after testing.

## Risks

- Overly aggressive pauses slow sync; overly small batches may still time out on slow Redmine deployments.
- Using backend.write_tasks could mask per-task failures if Redmine responds inconsistently.

## Verify Steps

- python -m py_compile .codex-swarm/agentctl.py .codex-swarm/backends/redmine/backend.py
- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task migrate --source .codex-swarm/tasks-export-small.json --quiet (optional smoke)
- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py sync redmine --direction push --yes --quiet (optional when Redmine reachable)

## Rollback Plan

- Revert redmine/backend.py and .codex-swarm/config.json to previous versions.
- Remove any partially migrated issues from the Redmine sandbox if needed.
