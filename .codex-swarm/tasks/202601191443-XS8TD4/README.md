description: "Add an order direction indicator and harden the board/list toggle behavior in the viewer."
---
## Summary

Add an order direction indicator and fix immediate board/list switching.

## Context

The viewer needs a visible sort direction cue and should switch views without a reload.

## Scope

- Add a direction icon to the order toggle.
- Harden the board/list toggle with explicit view sync.

## Risks

Risk: UI regressions if view visibility logic conflicts with CSS; keep changes localized.

## Verify Steps

- Click BOARD/LIST and confirm the view swaps instantly.
- Click Order and confirm the icon flips and ordering changes.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the updated toggle and visibility logic in `.codex-swarm/viewer/tasks.html`.

## Notes

No backend changes required.
