## Summary

Set tasks_backend.config_path to the local backend config so agentctl uses local task storage.

## Context

Requested to switch the task backend settings back to local.

## Scope

Updated tasks_backend.config_path in .codex-swarm/config.json to point at .codex-swarm/backends/local/backend.json.

## Risks

Low risk: only the backend selection changed. Risk is that workflows expecting the Redmine backend will now read/write local tasks instead.

## Verify Steps

python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py config show

## Rollback Plan

Run: python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py config set tasks_backend.config_path .codex-swarm/backends/redmine/backend.json

## Notes

Initial task creation timed out while the backend was set to Redmine; after switching to local, task creation succeeded.
