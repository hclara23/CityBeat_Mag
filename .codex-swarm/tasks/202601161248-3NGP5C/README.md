## Summary

Eliminated repetitive gating so plan approval becomes the main consent point and agents move forward autonomously thereafter.

## Scope

Adjusted AGENTS.md and ORCHESTRATOR.json wording so plan approval acts as the default authorization, and agents only re-check when scope or risk changes.

## Risks

Risk: agents may skip necessary confirmations if an unexpected scope/risk shift occurs, so we explicitly note when to re-check.

## Verify Steps

None (documentation-only change).

## Rollback Plan

Revert AGENTS.md and ORCHESTRATOR.json to their prior versions if the new guidance causes confusion or skips critical approvals.
