description: "Update the viewer UI to avoid rounded corners across controls and cards."
---
## Summary

Remove rounded corners from the viewer UI to match the requested sharp-edged style.

## Context

The current cyberpunk UI uses rounded corners across panels, cards, and controls. The request is to eliminate rounding.

## Scope

- Set border-radius values to 0 for viewer UI elements.
- Keep layout, spacing, and colors unchanged.

## Risks

Risk: Some elements may look harsh on small screens; keep spacing intact.

## Verify Steps

- Open the viewer and confirm panels, buttons, cards, and tables have square corners.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the border-radius changes in `.codex-swarm/viewer/tasks.html`.

## Notes

Apply consistently across dashboard and task views.
