description: "Revise ORCHESTRATOR/PLANNER specs and AGENTS.md to treat each request as a top-level plan, then prompt the user to create one or more tasks instead of maintaining docs/ROADMAP.md."
---
## Summary

Replace roadmap-specific orchestration with top-level plan and task proposal flow.

## Context

User prefers a top-level plan per request and a prompt to create one or more tasks, rather than maintaining docs/ROADMAP.md.

## Scope

Update AGENTS.md and ORCHESTRATOR/PLANNER JSON workflows to remove roadmap steps and require a post-plan task-creation prompt.

## Risks

Low risk; aligns agent expectations but must stay consistent across AGENTS.md and agent JSON.

## Verify Steps

No tests (spec changes only).

## Rollback Plan

Revert the commit to restore the prior roadmap workflow.
