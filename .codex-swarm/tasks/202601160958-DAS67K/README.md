description: "Review agentctl layout and specify UPGRADER responsibilities for automatic framework refresh, covering trigger conditions, config timestamp handling, and interactions with other agents."
---
## Summary
- Capture the new UPGRADER agent's purpose so the automation keeps framework metadata accurate and actions predictable.
- Describe the trigger rules, configuration dependencies, and downstream reporting that make the agent actionable.

## Context
- agentctl now exposes `upgrade`, a CLI path that must honor the `framework` section of `.codex-swarm/config.json` and stay aligned with the pinned base branch.
- CREATOR owns communicating how UPGRADER should be invoked (stale/forced), what it writes back to the config, and how other agents rely on it.

## Scope
- Document the staleness threshold (10 days) and forced path that decide when the agent runs.
- Spell out the required clean-tree/base-branch preconditions and the metadata (`framework.last_update`, `framework.source`) the agent reads/writes.
- Explain the expected outputs (updated config, run report, PR notes) so REVIEWER/INTEGRATOR know what to look for.

## Risks
- Forced pulls assume `git pull --ff-only` will succeed; if upstream diverges the command fails and the agent must surface that error.
- Network or GitHub availability affects automation; the agent must log retries/failures so humans can intervene.

## Verify Steps
- Review `.codex-swarm/agentctl.py` to ensure the upgrade command follows the documented behavior.
- Run `python3 -m unittest tests.test_framework_upgrade` to prove helper math that enters the spec works.
- Optionally execute `python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py upgrade --force` from a clean base branch to validate the end-to-end flow.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert the agent spec (`.codex-swarm/agents/UPGRADER.json`) and the section additions in `.codex-swarm/config.json` to drop the new metadata if problems surface.
- Revert any upgrade command invocations by resetting the branch to the prior commit, then re-run tests.

## Notes
- Downstream tasks cover the actual CLI implementation (`202601160958-NV8M5V`) and regression tests (`202601160958-AM3G42`), so keep this spec in sync with those artifacts.
